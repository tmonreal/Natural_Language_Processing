This repository contains the solved challenges for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) subject of the Specialization in Artificial Intelligence (CEIA) at the University of Buenos Aires.

## Contents

### [Challenge 1](https://github.com/tmonreal/Natural_Language_Processing/tree/main/1-Word2Vec)

- Introductory NLP notebook where document vectorization is performed using NumPy.

### [Challenge 2](https://github.com/tmonreal/Natural_Language_Processing/tree/main/2-HospitalBot)

- This challenge involves the developement of a simple bot for scheduling appointments at a hospital using TensorFlow and NLTK.

### [Challenge 3](https://github.com/tmonreal/Natural_Language_Processing/tree/main/3-WordEmbedding)

- This project focuses on generating word embeddings specifically tailored to the context of human anatomy and physiology. I leverage the powerful capabilities of Keras, scikit-learn, Gensim, and Plotly to develop these embeddings with precision and effectiveness.

### [Challenge 4](https://github.com/tmonreal/Natural_Language_Processing/tree/main/4-NextWordPrediction)

- Generating word embeddings that capture the contextual nuances of human anatomy and physiology is the objective of this challenge. This approach leverages the Keras Embedding layer, working in conjunction with a Bidirectional LSTM and a dense layer, to accurately forecast the next probable word based on the provided context.

### [Challenge 5](https://github.com/tmonreal/Natural_Language_Processing/tree/main/5-SentimentAnalysis)
<img width="706" alt="sentiment_analysis" src="https://github.com/tmonreal/Natural_Language_Processing/assets/84754265/e0e76356-b6aa-48ba-8465-364136baaf7a">

- In this challenge, I aim to develop a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that can accurately predict the rating (in terms of stars) based on customer reviews of purchased garments. To achieve this, the network incorporates a combination of Keras Embedding layer, Bidirectional LSTM layers, dense layers, and dropout layers. Moreover, an alternative network architecture has been implemented utilizing the FastText Embedding layer.

### [Challenge 6](https://github.com/tmonreal/Natural_Language_Processing/tree/main/6-ConversationalBot)
<img width="691" alt="qaBot" src="https://github.com/tmonreal/Natural_Language_Processing/assets/84754265/d009dfd2-1c66-4ac3-9b3d-b41fb76df80e">

- The main objective of this challenge is to create an intelligent conversational bot that excels in answering user questions based on English conversation data. To accomplish this, I employ a Seq2Seq model with an encoder-decoder architecture, which enables the bot to understand and generate accurate responses.
